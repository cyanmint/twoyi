# Build as both:
# 1. A shared library (cdylib) for JNI when loaded by Android app
# 2. A binary (bin) for standalone execution in Termux
# 
# The binary has a main() entry point for CLI mode.
# The cdylib exports JNI symbols for library mode.
# 
# Both share the same code - lib.rs contains all functionality.
